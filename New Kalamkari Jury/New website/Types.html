				<h4><p align="justify">There are two identifiable styles of Kalamkari art in India – Srikalahasti style and Machilipatnam style.
In the Machilipatnam style of Kalamkari, motifs are essentially printed with hand-carved traditional blocks with intricate detailing painted by hands. On the other hand, Srikalahasti style of painting draws inspiration from the Hindu mythology describing scenes from the epics and folklore. This style holds a strong religious connect because of its origin in the temples.<br><br>


The traders and merchants across the world used Kalamkari paintings as currency in the spice trade. There was a very high demand of spices like nutmeg, clove, and pepper as well as aromatic woods and oils, which were available almost exclusively in parts of Southeast Asia and Indonesia. The Southeast Asian and Indonesian traders demanded Indian textile in form of Kalamkari Paintings for ritual and ceremonial use.</p></h4><br><br>

					<h4 align="center"><b>Srikalahasti Style</b></h4>
			<br>
				<p align="center">Srikalahasti Temple in Andhra Pradesh is a popular pilgrimage site for Hindus dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple gained importance under Pallava rulers (6th -9th century AD). It was further expanded during Cholas (9th -13th Century AD) and Vijayanagara Empire (14th – 17th century AD). During those days, the paintings done on cloth were used as background or canopies to the God’s statues. Paintings usually were related to Hindu religion or nature. This style was done purely by free hand drawing using a bamboo stick with a hair-thin tip dipped in vegetable dyes.</p>

			<br>
				<p align="center">Machlipatnam was a port city during the medieval period of 15th -17th century AD. Machlipatnam style was an amalgamation of local motifs and cultural influence from Persia and Europe from where a lot of trade use to happen. So, the style was more global and wasn’t constrained by religion or mythology. They were more inclined towards patterns and shapes with respect to depicting flora and fauna including human figures. This technique included printing of bigger motifs on cloth with hand-carved traditional blocks and then painting the intricate details by hands.</p>
