The art of Kalamkari has existed for centuries as noted and often the designs were customised for the country that they were being exported to. The textile in picture to the below left is that of an intricately designed hanging made for the Siamese royal court. The design is customised to the Thai taste and is in lattice patterns. Figures of the Hindu deity Lord Brahma are seen in the pattern of nymphs and rosettes. The textile design depicted in The quilt depicted in picture to the below right is lined with Chinese silk and in done using vibrant colours like red, yellow, pink and blue. This is inspired by early 18th century European design.</p>

The designs and patterns made for home use had Indian traditional motifs which continue to this day and find expression in the overall design, generated for the end product which could be a panel, bag, apparel or item of upholstery. Though the motifs and designs can be broadly classified into figurative, floral, animal and geometric they have evolved with time and creativity of the artisans. The preferences of the clientele have influenced the designs. Today the work is customised and cater more to contemporary taste, yet retaining the classic signature of Kalamkari. The use of Kalamkari in the 21st century can be understood by reflecting on the use of the art in contemporary fashion. The most commonly used motifs are the paisley, floral, Buddha-face, creepers, peacock among others. The theme of Radha-Krishna is well used in figurative Kalamkari for panels and on sarees too. The recent trends show use of embellishments with gold ‘booti’ on the sarees as well.</p>
