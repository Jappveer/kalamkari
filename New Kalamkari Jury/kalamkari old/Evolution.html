An art which adorned the temples in olden times has come to our own homes in different forms and shapes. Artforms like Kalamkari have started gaining more and more popularity in recent times because of their no-chemical process of creating printed textiles. The start to finish process of this art involves use of vegetable dyes, fruit powder and minerals like iron to produce colors and paint, on an organic cotton cloth. Increasingly, people in the world are moving towards lesser use of chemicals in their lives and thus, anything organic and vegan is a preferred commodity for consumption in today’s world.
